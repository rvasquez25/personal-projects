Exercise 3 Write-up
The purpose of this lab was to use Dshell to decode packets we capture using Wireshark so we 
can understand what the malware was doing when executed on the victim machine. I did struggle 
towards the end when it came to using the decoder from the previous assignment, so I used the 
rot13.py example provided to decode the packets. I did get a better grasp of how to use Dshell to 
write my own decoders and as well how to read packets to decode from.
