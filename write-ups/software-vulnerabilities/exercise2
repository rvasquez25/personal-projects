Exercise 2 Write-up
The purpose of this exercise was to uncover a RAT known as ArchDeus. To do this, we must use 
Ghidra to analyze a DLL file we uncovered from the previous exercise. We can then look 
through the code and decompiler to find the decoded communication string used by the author of 
the malware and the code used to encode the code. We then use Netcat to establish a connection 
with the C2-Server to decode the response. I learned how to use Ghidra to look and decompile 
code and Netcat to connect to servers to test responses.
